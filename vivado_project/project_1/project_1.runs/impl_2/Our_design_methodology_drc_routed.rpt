2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance A5/arrayW_reg_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_25_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_clk_25_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_25_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>
